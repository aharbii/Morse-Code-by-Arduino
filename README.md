# Morse-Code-by-Arduino

It's a college project for Logic Gates Subject. I chose this project to apply coding system in real life so I tried to transform ASCII code into Morse code and to begin dealing with microcontrollers.

Arduino transmitter which convert English words into Morse code then represent it in light and sound with laser and buzzer. Arduino receives words through serial bluetooth communication. I build Android application and desktop application using "MIT app inventor, Python 3.7, PyQt4, Serial package". I also used Image Processing to recognize text through image or video through cam and then send it to the arduino using "Python 3.7, OpenCV, Tesseract OCR, Serial package".
